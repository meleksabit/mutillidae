# $\color{LimeGreen}{OWASP\ Mutillidae\ II\ -\ Forked\ to\ showcase\ DevSecOps\ pipelines\}$

OWASP Mutillidae II is a free, open-source, deliberately vulnerable web application designed for web-security enthusiasts. It serves as a target for learning and practicing web security skills. Mutillidae can be easily installed on Linux and Windows systems using LAMP, WAMP, and XAMMP stacks. Additionally, it comes pre-installed on SamuraiWTF and OWASP BWA, and the existing version can be updated on these platforms. With dozens of vulnerabilities and hints to guide the user, Mutillidae provides an accessible web hacking environment suitable for labs, security enthusiasts, classrooms, CTFs, and vulnerability assessment tool targets. It has been widely used in graduate security courses, corporate web security training, and as an assessment target for vulnerability assessment software. OWASP Mutillidae II provides a comprehensive platform for learning and practicing web security techniques in a controlled environment.
